Description: Enriched heatmap is a special type of heatmap which 
  visualizes the enrichment of genomic signals on specific target regions.
  Here we implement enriched heatmap by ComplexHeatmap package. 
  Since this type of heatmap is just a normal heatmap but with some special settings, 
  with the functionality of ComplexHeatmap, it would be much easier
  to customize the heatmap as well as concatenating to a list of heatmaps to 
  show correspondance between different data sources.
